# General mechanism

This repository supports the reporting of transmitted frames in addition to notifications of received frames similar to CAN232 and CANUSB.


# Rx frame reporting

When a CAN frame is received, it is notified in the same format as the transmission command: `r`, `R`, `t`, `T`, `d`, `D`, `b` and `B`.
This function is enabled by default and can be disabled by `z` command.
If disabled, the device will not send any data to the host even if it receives CAN frames.

The Rx frame reporting is summarized in the table bellow.
See Content in report for the details of `<Rx frame>`.

| Rx frame reporting | Timing          | Report       |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------ |
| Disabled           | Receive a frame | -            |
| Enabled            | Receive a frame | `<Rx frame>` |

Example:
- `t10020011[CR]`

This message will be sent from the device when a classical CAN data frame with ID = 0x100 and 2 data bytes with the valued 0x00 and 0x11 is received.


# Tx event reporting

When a CAN frame is transmitted and acknowledged by another node, it is notified by the transmission command with a `z` or `Z` at the beginning.
This function is disabled by default and can be enabled by `z` command.
If disabled, the device responds with `z[CR]` or `Z[CR]` when the transmission command is in the correct format and successfully saved in the buffer instead of reporting successful transmission.

The Tx event reporting is summarized in the table bellow.
See Content in report for the details of `<Tx event>`.

| Tx event reporting | Timing                             | Report             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Disabled           | Save the Tx frame in the buffer    | `z[CR]` or `Z[CR]` |
| Disabled           | Fail to save the Tx frame          | `[BELL]`           |
| Disabled           | Successfully transmit the Tx frame | -                  |
| Enabled            | Save the Tx frame in the buffer    | -                  |
| Enabled            | Fail to save the Tx frame          | `[BELL]`           |
| Enabled            | Successfully transmit the Tx frame | `<Tx event>`       |

Example:
- `zt10020011[CR]`

This message will be sent from the device when a classical CAN data frame with ID = 0x100 and 2 data bytes with the valued 0x00 and 0x11 is transmitted.


# Content in report

The `<Rx frame>` and `<Tx event>` always contain the type of frame, CAN ID, DLC and Data bytes (for data frames).
The following items can be added to them:

- Timestamp : Milli/micro second timestamp in hex, configurable with `Z` or `z` commands.
- Error state indicator : ESI flag (0: Error active, 1: Error passive), configurable with `z` commands.

Format:
- `<z>riiil<tt...><e>[CR]` (Base remote frame)
- `<Z>Riiiiiiiil<tt...><e>[CR]` (Extended remote frame)
- `<z>xiiildd...<tt...><e>[CR]` (Base data frame)
- `<Z>Xiiiiiiiildd...<tt...><e>[CR]` (Extended data frame)

Where `<z>` or `<Z>` is used for `<Tx event>`, `x` = `t` / `d` / `b`, `X` = `T` / `D` / `B`, `<tt...>` is timestamp and `<e>` is ESI.

Example 1:
- `t10020011000A0[CR]`

Denotes an incoming classical CAN data frame with ID = 0x100 and 2 data bytes with the valued 0x00 and 0x11.
Additionally, milli second time stamp is activated and is 10 ms and ESI is 0 = error active.

Example 2:
- `zr20030000000F[CR]`

Denotes a successful transmission of classical CAN remote frame with ID = 0x200 and DLC = 3.
Additionally, micro second time stamp is activated and is 15 us.
