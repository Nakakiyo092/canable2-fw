# General rules

All commands to the device must be terminated with CR and they are CASE sensitive.

All response from the device is terminated with CR except BELL for ERROR.
The hexadecimal (hex) values are expressed with capital letters.


Special ascii codes
- CR (Ascii 13 / `'\r'`) : Used for OK or termination
- BELL (Ascii 7 / `'\a'`) : Used for ERROR


Data length code (DLC)
- `0-8`: Same as data length
- `9`: Length = 12
- `A`: Length = 16
- `B`: Length = 20
- `C`: Length = 24
- `D`: Length = 32
- `E`: Length = 48
- `F`: Length = 64

Note:
- The milli second timestamp is taken after the CAN frame transmission is complete, 
  while the micro second timestamp is taken at the start of CAN frame.
