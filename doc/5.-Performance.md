The communication speed between the device and a host (e.g., a PC) is limited by the following factors:

- USB High Speed, with a maximum speed of 12Mbps
- Text-based Communications Device Class protocol

As a result, the communication speed on the USB side is insufficient to fully transmit all data on the CAN FD bus.

The maximum speed on USB CDC is approximately 4Mbps (500kBytes/s) to 6Mbps (750kBytes/s), which corresponds to a 60% - 90% bus load on a 1Mbps/5Mbps CAN FD bus.
However, this value also depends on the process speed of the application in the host side.

If you attempt to transmit or receive more data than this limit, you will encounter message loss.
You can check for this loss using the `F` or `f` commands.

Properly filtering CAN frames with the `W`, `M`, and `m` commands will help reduce message and ensure that all necessary data is received.
