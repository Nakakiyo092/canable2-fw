### Mechanism

The received frames are filtered based only on its CAN ID and type of CAN ID.

The following table shows the relationship between filter code, mask and received CAN ID.
The table corresponding to the type of CAN ID is applied.


| 11bit ID |          |            |     |            |                |               |
|----------|----------|------------|-----|------------|----------------|---------------|
| Code     | AC0 bit7 | AC0 bit6-0 | AC1 | AC2 bit7-3 | AC2 bit2-0     | AC3           |
| Mask     | AM0 bit7 | AM0 bit6-0 | AM1 | AM2 bit7-3 | AM2 bit2-0     | AM3           |
| Rx frame | 1        | -          | -   | -          | CAN ID bit10-8 | CAN ID bit7-0 |


| 29bit ID |          |            |                  |                  |                 |                | 
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------| 
| Code     | AC0 bit7 | AC0 bit6-5 | AC0 bit4-0       | AC1              | AC2             | AC3            |
| Mask     | AM0 bit7 | AM0 bit6-5 | AM0 bit4-0       | AM1              | AM2             | AM3            |
| Rx frame | 0        | -          | CAN ID bit 28-24 | CAN ID bit 23-16 | CAN ID bit 15-8 | CAN ID bit 7-0 |


Here '-' means the corresponding bit is not used for acceptance decision.
The received frame is accepted if the following condition is satisfied for every bits.

` (Code) & (~Mask) == (Rx frame) & (~Mask) `

### Examples

Example 1:
* Mode - `W2[CR]`
* Code - `M00000000[CR]`
* Mask - `mFFFFFFFF[CR]`

All bits are disabled by acceptance mask i.e. all frames are received.
This is default when power on.


Example 2:
* Mode - `W2[CR]`
* Code - `M80000100[CR]`
* Mask - `m00000000[CR]`

The base CAN ID `0x100` is accepted and the other base CAN IDs are ignored.
All extended CAN IDs are ignored.


Example 3:
* Mode - `W2[CR]`
* Code - `M18DB0000[CR]`
* Mask - `m0000FFFF[CR]`

All extended CAN IDs between `0x18DB0000` and `0x18DBFFFF` are accepted.
The other extended CAN IDs and all base CAN IDs are ignored.
